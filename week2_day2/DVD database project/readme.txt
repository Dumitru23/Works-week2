This project is to proove knowledge I gain during the SQL-Data Analytics Course 

We will perform data analysis using SQL, using the tables provided by a DVD rental Database.

actor (actor_id, first_name, last_name)

film (film_id, title, description, release_year,language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate,replacement_cost, rating)

film_actor(film_id, actor_id)

customer(customer_id, first_name, last_name, address_id)

payment(payment_id, customer_id, amount, date)

address(address_id, street, city_id, phone)

rental(rental_id, rental_date, customer_id, inventory_id)

inventory(inventory_id, film_id, store_id)

Each Querry was short attach to a specific topic and I gave a small explanation as well. 

I will showcase various SQL techniques including self join, natural join,
 left and right outer join, full join, natural join, subqueries, window function , case when. 
 
I also used membership operators (in, not in), group by, order by, aggregate functions, regular expressions, 
 and more.
